**Data Types**: Integers, Floats, Booleans, Strings  
**Operators**: Arithmetic, Assignment, Comparison, Logical, Membership, Identity   
**Data Structures**: Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries, Compound Data Structure

### Arithmetic Operators
- `+` Addition
- `-` Subtraction
- `*` Multiplication
- `/` Division
- `%` Mod (the remainder after dividing)
- `**` Exponentiation (note that ^ does not do this operation, as you might have seen in other languages)
- `//` Divides and rounds down to the nearest integer

More information of **Bitwise operator** can be find [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BitwiseOperators).

### Assignment Operators
- `=` 
- `+=`
- `-=`

### Comparision Operators
- `>`	Greater than 
- `<`	Less than
- `==` Equal to 
- `!=` Not equal to 
- `>=` Greater than or equal to 
- `<=` Less than or equal to 

### Logical Operators
- `and` 
- `or`
- `not`

### Methods
- A method in Python behaves similarly to a function. Methods actually are functions that are called using **dot notation**. 
- Methods are **specific to the data type** for a particular variable. So there are some built-in methods that are available for all strings, different methods that are available for all integers, etc.
- Important string methods: `.format()`, `.split()`
